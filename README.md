Tips for use:

  - when sorting it prioritizes capital letters before lowercase letters (ex. 'Z' would be before 'a')

  - When adding an event:
        - leave both the location and end time field empty to make the event a deadline
        - leaving just the location empty will automatically make the meeting "Online"
        - entering invalid formats or not filling all the required information won't prompt an error or anything within the GUI
